IDENTIFYING (ODD) CHARACTERS

show character under cursor as ascii
    ga
show character under cursor as utf8, including unicode and hex codes
    g8
Find an illegal UTF-8 byte sequence at or after the cursor.
    8g8
    Note: works either 1) when 'encoding' is any 8-bit encoding or 2) when 'encoding' is 
    "utf-8" and 'fileencoding' is any 8-bit encoding

On a single line you can use f<char> and then ; to go forward or , to go backward.
On multiple line, you must use /<char> and then n to go forward (or N backward).
Alternatively, your problem might be solved by using regexp and substitute, ie
    :%s/[your odd character]//g
To manage to copy and paste your "odd character", you should go in visual using v to select 
the character, then y+ESC. Then type:
    :%s/<CTRL+r>"//g
<CTRL+r>" will copy the content of the copy register in the command line.

Alternatively, open vim with the -b switch for binary mode (will show characters such as windows eol, e.g. "^M").
