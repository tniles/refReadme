Most relevant info for cygwin is implemented in my aliases file. This is mostly a log for
interesting errors and workarounds.

Find a program by package:
    cygcheck -p strings.exe

Using an X server: startxwin does a good job.

Fork errors (child and parent mismatches):
    Typically means you need to rebase. This can be caused by either reconfiguring
    (installing/uninstalling) cygwin packages, or by the windows OS itself (in particular,
    invasive hooks from DLLs).

    NOTE: it may be necessary to perform these steps immediately after a clean re/boot.
        Open C:\Cygwin\bin in Windows Explorer
        Run as Administrator dash.exe
        Type /usr/bin/rebaseall -v, hit enter, and wait for the process to complete.

    STORY: I had a working x server (through startxwin) and it stopped working, citing a
    similar fork error. This was after I had done a handful of install/uninstall operations
    through the cygwin setup program. Performing a rebaseall got the X server/client running
    again. However, gvim still had a fork error and would not load, even though kdiff3-qt
    would. With a reboot, another rebase or two, and another reboot, everything was
    operational again, including gvim.

    STORY2: After rebooting one day cygwin could not start, period. These forking errors were
    to blame, several of them (slowly) filling the screen and would not allow cygwin to start.
    A successful rebase righted the behavior, although it returned after a reboot. To finally
    solve this, it took a reboot, a rebase, a reinstall of a single package (I chose gnuplot),
    and another reboot and everything was working fine again.

    The following is a relevant answer from StackOverflow (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9300722/cygwin-error-bash-fork-retry-resource-temporarily-unavailable):

    (assuming Cygwin is installed at C:\Cygwin):

    Open Task Manager and close any processes that look to be Cygwin related.
    Open C:\Cygwin\bin in Windows Explorer
    Verify that dash.exe, ash.exe, rebase.exe, and rebaseall exist in this folder
        If any of them are missing, re-run Cygwin setup and select the dash, ash, and rebase 
        packages right-click your C:\Cygwin folder, uncheck Read-only (if its checked), and 
        press OK.
        When an error about not being able to switch some files comes up, select "Ignore All".
        Wait for this process to complete.
    Browse to C:\Cygwin\bin in Windows Explorer
    Right click dash.exe and click "Run as Administrator". A command Prompt should appear with nothing 
    but a $
    Type /usr/bin/rebaseall -v, hit enter, and wait for the process to complete.
        If you get errors about Cygwin processes running, try Step 1 again. If that still 
        doesn't work, Restart your computer into safe mode and try these steps again.
        A commenter noted that, depending on your settings, you may have to type
          cd /usr/bin && ./rebaseall -v instead.
    Try opening Cygwin again.

    This process worked for me. I hope it works for you guys too.

Error: "cygcrypt-0.dll missing" and other complaints about not being able to source libraries
related to this dll. Solution: re/install other libraries which depend on libcrypt* (e.g.
libattr1).
