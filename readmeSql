Convert from SQLite to MySQL

Q: Anyone know a quick easy way to migrate a SQLite3 database to MySQL?


A: Here is a list of converters:

An alternative method that would work nicely but is rarely mentioned is: use a ORM class that abstracts the specific database differences away for you. e.g. you get these in PHP (RedBean), Python (Django's ORM layer, Storm, SqlAlchemy), Ruby on Rails ( ActiveRecord), Cocoa (CoreData)

i.e. you could do this:

    Load data from source database using the ORM class.
    Store data in memory or serialize to disk.
    Store data into destination database using the ORM class.
