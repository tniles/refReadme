Page numbering:

Here a solution based on LaTeX. It uses the pdfpages package to include the scanned PDF (here 
called scan.pdf). The PDF page labels you want can be set using the hyperref package with the
pdfpagelabels option enabled. It uses the normal \thepage macro as a label which can be 
defined to lower case roman numbers. The page counter is then reset and changed back to normal
numbers.

\documentclass[a4paper]{article}% or use 'letterpaper'
\usepackage{pdfpages}
\usepackage[pdfpagelabels]{hyperref}
\begin{document}
% Set lower case roman numbers (\Roman would be upper case):
\renewcommand{\thepage}{\roman{page}}
\includepdf[pages=1-3]{scan.pdf}
% % Back to normal (arabic) numbers:
\renewcommand{\thepage}{\arabic{page}}
% Reset page counter to 1:
\setcounter{page}{1}
\includepdf[pages=4-]{scan.pdf}
\end{document}

Place the above code into a file (e.g. scan_mod.tex) and compile it with pdflatex:

# pdflatex scan_mod

This will produce scan_mod.pdf. However any special annotations incl. hyperlinks will 
disappear. This shouldn't be any problem with scanned PDFs.

If you need this more often you could write a script which accepts the number of roman 
numbered pages and the file name(s) as arguments and creates a tempfile with the above code 
where the name and numbers are variables, which is then compiled.
