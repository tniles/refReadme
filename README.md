# refReadme
These are documents I use to record information that helped me complete or do something. If 
there is something I didn't get around to trying, I've placed a "Try Sometime" preceding it.

If it's scriptable, I probably wrote a script for it. A lot of this stuff just makes it
less painful for me to reference a variety of tools.

These are here with no guarantees of fitment or purpose, and are intended as a reference for
advanced users. Use at your own risk.
