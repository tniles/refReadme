Page labels (renumbering pages):

What you want is indeed called page labels and can easily be added directly in the PDF's 
source code. Rename the file extension from pdf to txt and open the file in a text editor 
(this can be slow, depending on the file size, be patient). The information about page labels
is stored in a node called the document catalog which looks something like this:

3 0 obj
<< /Type /Catalog
   /Pages 1 0 R
>>
endobj

It may contain more confusing stuff, but this is the basic structure. There is only one 
catalog, so in a large file you can search for the node that contains /Catalog. Now you can 
make your desired changes by inserting the /PageLabels entry:

3 0 obj
<< /Type /Catalog
   /Pages 1 0 R
   /PageLabels << /Nums [ 0 << /P (cover) >>
                          % labels 1st page with the string "cover"
                          1 << /S /r >>
                          % numbers pages 2-6 in small roman numerals
                          6 << /S /D >>
                          % numbers pages 7-x in decimal arabic numerals
                        ]
               >>
>>
endobj

There are 3 lines starting with numbers, called page indices. Page 1 has the index 0, page 2
the index 1 and so forth. They always describe ranges, so the line with 1 <<...>> applies to
all pages from index 1 to 5 and the line with 6 <<...>> applies to all pages from 6 up to the 
last page. A label for 0 <<...>> must always be defined.

You can find more information about page labels and PDF source code in the PDF standard or in 
a wiki on PDF standards.
