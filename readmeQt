To use qtCreator to debug like VS

> Build the app as above, with qmake and make.
> /opt/Qt5.3.1/Tools/QtCreator/bin/qtcreator &
> Open project, foo.pro in the foo repo

(The first time, it will ask you to configure the project.
Just accept the defaults.)

> Go to the Projects tab on the left.
> Make sure the Shadow build checkbox is not checked.
> make sure the qmake and Make specs make sense.
> Go to the Run tab at the top of the page next to build tab.
> On the Run Settings page:
> Select from Run Configuration dropdown list: app
> Change the "Working directory" to the foo runtime bin. 

E.g., ~/Desktop/foo/public/Linux64/debug/runtime/bin

> Press the debug play button, the play button with a bug on it.
    OR
  You can start ./runApp.sh from a Terminal window, then attach from Qt:
> At the top of the Qt window, click on Debug->Start Debugging->Attach to running application.
> On the list of running applications, near the top, select ~/.app
> When you attach, it will stop the app. To continue, click the
  green Continue icon on the left of the screen (below the Run arrow).
> Now you can insert break points etc.

Attach to process in QtCreator

Sometimes it can be difficult to setup QtCreator for the foo project. It builds fine in the 
terminal, but you have to create lots of custom rules to get it to build in QtCreator. You 
don't care about editing files or building in QtCreator, you just want to use QtCreator to 
debug the app that was built from the terminal.

Launch app from the terminal. If you need to debug startup code, add a popup window as early
as possible in the program. This will give you time to attach the debugger and set breakpoints
before you hit OK to continue.

// sudo /opt/Qt5.3.1/Tools/QtCreator/bin/qtcreator &
// WARNING: DO NOT run builds or edit files from QtCreator when running it with sudo.
// This will hijack your file permissions and set them to root, which can cause headaches next
// time you try to build from the terminal. It is best to not even open the foo project when
// running QtCreator with sudo. Remember: you are here to use the debugger, nothing else.
//
// From QtCreator, click Debug >> Start Debugging >> Attach to running application
// Select app in the list and click "Attach to Process"
// Now you can set your breakpoints.  click File >> open file or project, and navigate to the 
// file where you want to set a breakpoint.
